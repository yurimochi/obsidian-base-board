# Base Board

**Base Board** is an interactive, property-driven Kanban board view for [Obsidian Bases](https://obsidian.md). It allows you to organize your notes into visual columns based on any property in your frontmatter, providing a seamless drag-and-drop experience for managing tasks and structured data.

## Key Features

- **Property-Based Columns**: Instantly generate columns from any frontmatter property.
- **Intuitive Drag & Drop**: Move cards between columns to update their properties automatically, and reorder cards within a column.
- **Inline Power**: Rename cards or column titles directly on the board.
- **Native Editing Modal**: Open any card into a fully-functional Obsidian editor floating directly over your workspace.
- **Rich Cards**: View key metadata fields as chips on each card for a quick overview.
- **Configurable Card Title**: Set `cardTitleProperty: note.title` in your `.base` file to use a frontmatter property (e.g. `title`) as the card heading instead of the filename.
- **Tags**: Color-coded tag chips on cards with a clickable filter bar to narrow the board by tag.
- **Hover Preview**: Native note previews on hover (uses the **Page preview** core plugin).
- **One-Click Creation**: Add new notes directly to a specific column without leaving the board view.
- **WIP Limits**: Set per-column work-in-progress limits via the column header context menu. Columns that exceed their limit are highlighted in red.
- **Collapsible Columns**: Collapse any column to save space; the state is remembered per board.
- **Card Cover Images**: Display cover images at the top of cards by specifying an image frontmatter property (e.g., `cover: "[[image.png]]"` or a web URL). Defaults to the `cover` property.
- **Data First**: All changes are written directly to your Markdown files.

## Usage

Open the **Command palette** (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`) and run **"Base Board: Create new board"**. Enter a name, choose a folder, and the plugin will scaffold everything for you — a `.base` file, a tasks folder, and sample task notes. The board opens automatically.

### Card Navigation & Selection

By default, card interaction respects native Obsidian conventions:

- **Click:** Open the card's note in the active tab / pane.
- **Ctrl/Cmd + Click:** Open the note in a new tab.
- **Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + Click** (or **Cmd + Option + Click** on macOS): Open the note to the side in a split pane.
- **Alt / Option + Click:** Toggle selection of a card (for bulk actions or dragging).
- **Shift + Click:** Select a range of cards.

You can customize the default click behavior (e.g. to always open in a floating modal, split pane, or new tab) via the board toolbar under the view options menu.

### Card Ordering

Base Board uses manual drag order so cards remain exactly where you place them. This order is stored in each note's `kanban_order` property and overrides the native Bases **Sort by** setting.

### Customizing New Cards (`newItemFolder`, `newItemTemplate`, `newItemProperties`)

Cards created from **"+ Add card"** can be customized per board via your `.base` file:

```yaml
views:
  - type: kanban
    name: Frontend Board
    newItemFolder: Tasks
    newItemTemplate: Templates/task.md
    newItemProperties:
      team: frontend
      category: alpha
```

- **`newItemFolder`** — creates new cards inside this folder (relative to the vault root), creating it if it doesn't exist yet. Make sure your board's filter actually matches files in that folder, or the new card will immediately disappear from the board.
- **`newItemTemplate`** — path to a note used as the starting point for new cards: its frontmatter and body content (headings, checklists, etc.) are applied to every new card. Supports the same placeholders as Obsidian's core Templates plugin: `{{title}}`, `{{date}}` / `{{date:FORMAT}}`, and `{{time}}` / `{{time:FORMAT}}`.
- **`newItemProperties`** — default frontmatter properties merged into every new card.

Precedence when several of these set the same property: the board's own values always win — `newItemTemplate` frontmatter is applied first, then `newItemProperties`, then the column's groupBy value and `kanban_order` — so a template can supply sensible defaults without breaking the board's own bookkeeping fields.
